# FesiProject
Final project of an academic course in Signal and Image Processing Fundamentals
## Main Objectives

- Replicating the filter that, given a color image and a color range, highlights the colors within this range by transforming everything else into grayscale (monochromatic_filter.ipynb);
- Creating a filter similar to the one described above, but which, given a color range, transforms the colors within this range into grayscale while leaving everything else unchanged (monochromatic_inverseFilter.ipynb);
- Creating a filter that, given a color image and a color range, transforms the colors within this range into grayscale and remaps all other colors within the selected range ((monochromaticBackgroundFilter.ipynb)).

## Failures

Inside the "failures" repository there are some failed attempts of the filters when they were still in development.

For further information about the project (functions and methods used, thought process, failures and related solutions and various observations) read finalProjectFESI.ipynb or finalProject.pdf (I apologize in that is in italian, I have yet to find the time to translate it)
