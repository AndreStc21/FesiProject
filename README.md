# FesiProject
Final project of an academic course in Signal and Image Processing Fundamentals
## Main Objectives

- Replicating the filter that, given a color image and a color range, highlights the colors within this range by transforming everything else into grayscale;
- Creating a filter similar to the one described above, but which, given a color range, transforms the colors within this range into grayscale while leaving everything else unchanged;
- Creating a filter that, given a color image and a color range, transforms the colors within this range into grayscale and remaps all other colors within the selected range.
